           <h2>Taekwondo Makes Children Smarter</h2>
           <p>Studies have shown that when children participate in physical activities such as Taekwondo at a young age, they tend to perform better in school than those who do not. The students who are physically active have higher IQs, perform better in social environments, receive better school grades, and have greater self esteem</p>

   <br>
   <br>
   <h2>Self-Discipline and Self-Esteem for Your Child</h2>
   <p>Taekwondo emphasizes moral development. Children learn respect for themselves and others, heighten concentration, and increase self-discipline and self-restraint. The self-discipline that develops as a result of learning and practicing Taekwondo carries over into other areas of the child's life. School grades often improve as your child learns to focus on objectives and work toward achievment. The self-discipline and self-respect which Taekwondo develops can provide your child with the skills and mindset necessary to resist peer pressure.</p>
